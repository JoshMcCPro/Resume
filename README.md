# Welcome to my GitHub repository - "Resume" - where I showcase all my remarkable Computer Science projects!

In this repository, you'll find a collection of my finest creations, demonstrating my skills and passion for software development. From innovative games to practical applications, each project represents my journey as a Computer Science student and aspiring entrepreneur.

Dive into my "resume" repository to explore:

## Database Final: 
A dynamic text menu-based application built using MySQL and C++. Manipulate and access data in a database, handling employees, customers, orders, products, product types, and time clock records with ease.

## Data Structures Final: 
Experience a unique twist on the classic Tower of Hanoi problem with my C++ game. Instead of circles, you'll encounter letters to sort in alphabetical order â€“ a challenging and entertaining experience.

## Computer Science 2 Final: 
Test your geometry knowledge in this engaging 2-player game. Roll the dice to decide who goes first, then take turns answering geometry math questions with varying point values. Can you be the ultimate geometry master?

## Java Software Development Final: 
Embrace the addictive world of cookies in this Java-based game inspired by "Cookie Clicker." Click your way to cookie riches, unlock upgrades like Mines, Grandmas, and Farms, and earn achievements as you bake your way to success!

With these projects, I aim to impress and inspire. Join me on this exciting journey of creativity and technical prowess as I strive to make a mark in the world of Computer Science and software development.
