Dive into the world of precision and skill with "The Weapon Thrower" - a thrilling game where players test their accuracy by throwing swords into melons. The goal is to score as many points as possible by sticking swords into the melon without hitting others. Aim carefully to hit special targets for high bonus points, but beware of hitting your own swords!

### 🏆 Key Accomplishments:
- Developed an immersive gameplay experience using Unreal Engine and C++, implementing realistic physics and intuitive controls.
- Designed the scoring system, rewarding players based on the number of swords stuck in the melon without collisions.
- Implemented high-risk, high-reward mechanics, introducing special targets for significant bonus points and introducing a penalty for hitting swords.
- Created an in-game store where players can purchase unique weapons to enhance their throwing skills and further challenge themselves.
- Added a word search mini-game within the main game, allowing players to gather letters and earn valuable bonus items.

"The Weapon Thrower" showcases my passion for game development, problem-solving abilities, and proficiency with Unreal Engine and C++. The project is a testament to my dedication to creating engaging and immersive gaming experiences.
