Dive into the world of precision and skill with "The Weapon Thrower," a thrilling game where players test their accuracy by throwing swords into melons. The goal is to score as many points as possible by sticking swords into the melon without hitting others. Aim carefully to hit special targets for high bonus points, but beware of hitting your own swords!

**Key Accomplishments:**
- Developed an immersive gameplay experience using Unreal Engine and C++
- Designed the scoring system, rewarding players based on the number of swords stuck in the melon
- Implemented high-risk, high-reward mechanics with special targets and penalties
- Created an in-game store for purchasing unique weapons
- Added a word search mini-game for extra engagement
