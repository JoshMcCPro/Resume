# Welcome to my GitHub repository - "Resume" - where I showcase all my remarkable Computer Science projects!

In this repository, you'll find a collection of my finest creations, demonstrating my skills and passion for software development. From fun games to practical applications, each project represents my journey as a Computer Science student and aspiring entrepreneur.

Dive into my "resume" repository to explore:

## Database Final: 
A dynamic text menu-based application built using MySQL and C++. Manipulate and access data in a database, handling employees, customers, orders, products, product types, and time clock records with ease.

## Data Structures Final: 
Experience a unique twist on the classic Tower of Hanoi problem with my C++ game. Instead of circles, you'll encounter letters to sort in alphabetical order â€“ a challenging and entertaining experience.
