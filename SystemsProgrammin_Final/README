FINAL EXAM (Programming Portion)
Due Date: May 5 @ 11:59PM EDT
Points: 50% of the Final Exam

Here you will implement the "cp" command from Linux in 32-bit NASM assembly. 
I've already started the program, you will need to finish it. Use the comments 
to help you finish the program.

Tips:
	- You will want to look at the opcode table for each of the system calls 
	  used. Keep in mind that we are using 32-bit registers here.

	- System calls used in this program:
	  - open
	  - read
	  - creat
	  - write
	  - close (invoked twice!)

	- The cat program we did in h4 is similar to this, but we are outputting to 
	  another file, and not stdout (the terminal screen), so some extra steps 
	  will need to be done in order to go from cat to cp.
